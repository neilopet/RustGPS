GPS for Rust Alpha

When Rust was released in its alpha stage, radar was a coveted item that nobody seemed to have.

This was the client for our GPS app which allowed myself and a select few of my friends to have a real-time radar that displayed allies, enemies, heading, NPCs, airdrops, and supported labeling landmarks.

This code hasn't been updated since February 17th, 2014 so I'm not sure if it still works.

As always, use it responsibly.

P.S. Please disregard the mess.  It was never revised because of the time sensitivity of the project.  It's a cheat and we wanted our fun before the window closed.
