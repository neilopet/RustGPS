GPS for Rust Alpha

When Rust was released in its alpha stage, radar was a coveted item that nobody seemed to have.

This was the client for our QPS app which allowed myself and a select few of my friends to have a real-time radar that displayed allies, enemies, heading, NPCs, airdrops, and supported labeling landmarks.

This code hasn't been updated since February 17th, 2014 so I'm not sure if it still works.

As always, use it responsibly.
